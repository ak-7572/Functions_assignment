    "# Q10. What is the difference between `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` functions in Python?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# In Python, `map()`, `reduce()`, and `filter()` are built-in functions used to process and transform sequences, but they serve different purposes. Here’s a simple explanation of each:\n",
    "\n",
    "# 1. `map()`\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose : Applies a function to each item in an iterable and returns a new iterable with the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How It Works :\n",
    "# You provide a function and an iterable (like a list).\n",
    "# `map()` applies the function to every item in the iterable.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example :\n",
    "def square(x):\n",
    "    return x * x\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "# `map()` takes the `square` function and applies it to each item in the `numbers` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. `filter()` :\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose : Filters items in an iterable based on a function that returns `True` or `False`, and returns a new iterable with only the items that are `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How It Works :\n",
    "# You provide a function that returns `True` or `False` and an iterable.\n",
    "# `filter()` applies the function to each item and keeps only the items where the function returns `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example :\n",
    "def is_even(x):\n",
    "    return x % 2 == 0\n",

    "\n",
    "# `filter()` takes the `is_even` function and applies it to each item in the `numbers` list, keeping only the even numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3. `reduce()` :\n",
    "\n",
    "# Purpose : Applies a function cumulatively to the items in an iterable, reducing them to a single result.\n",
    "\n",
    "# How It Works :\n",
    "# You provide a function and an iterable.\n",
    "# `reduce()` applies the function to the first two items, then takes the result and applies the function to the next item, and so on, until only one result remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Example :\n",
    "from functools import reduce\n",
    "\n",
    "def add(x, y):\n",

    "# Summary of Differences :\n",

    "# `map()` : Transforms each item in an iterable with a given function and returns a new iterable with the transformed items.\n",
